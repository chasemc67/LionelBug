### Mac Malware to Annoy My Brother

A small piece of Mac Malware I wrote to annoy my brother.  
The delivery mechanism is a song that LOOKS like an mp3.  
Upon double clicking, it sets a malicious chron job.  

Thereafter, every ~15 minutes, it:  
* downloads a picture of Lionel Richie, 
* displays it on the screen infront of your work
* and says "Hello, is it me you're looking for".
